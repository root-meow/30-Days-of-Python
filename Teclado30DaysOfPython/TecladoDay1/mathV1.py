#When dividing numbers, regardless of whether they are integers or floats
# the result is always a float.

#Addition
print(1 + 2)
print(3.4 + 11)
print(8 + 4.0)

#Subtraction
print(7 - 5)
print(5 - 11.0)
print(-4 - 9)

#Multiplication
print(4 * 7)
print(2 * 29.0)
print(8.2 * 34)

#Division
print(5 / 6.5)
print(20 / 2)
print(5.5 / 0.5)

#In the case where we are using multiple operators, use BODMAS
#It is great to space the operators. However, you can also forego the space to make it easier for readers to get the operations at a glance.
print( (4 - 5 ) * (5 + 3) / 2)
