"""Welcome to the Day 12 project in 30 Days of Python! We're going to create a program that can store and display books from a user's 
reading list.

Down below you'll find a full project brief as well as a walkthrough for our solution. Remember your solution doesn't 
have to match ours exactly!
ยง
The brief

For this project the application needs to have the following functionality:

    1. Users should be able to add a book to their reading list by providing a book title, an author's name, and a year of publication.
    2. The program should store information about all of these books in a Python list.
    3. Users should be able to display all the books in their reading list, and these books should be printed out in a user-friendly 
    format.
    4. Users should be able to select these options from a text menu, and they should be able to perform multiple operations without
    restarting the program. You can see an example of a working menu in the post on while loops (day 8)."""


#Day 14 implementation.

"""The brief

For this project the application needs to have the following functionality:

    Users should be able to add a book to their reading list by providing a book title, an author's name, and a year of publication.
    The program should store information about all of these books in a file called books.csv, and this data should be stored in CSV format.
    Users should be able to retrieve the books in their reading list, and these books should be printed out in a user-friendly format.
    Users should be able to search for a specific book by providing a book title.
    Users should be able to select these options from a text menu, and they should be able to perform multiple operations without restarting the program. You can see an example of a working menu in the post on while loops (day 8)."""
