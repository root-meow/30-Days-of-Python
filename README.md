# 30 Days of Python
Everything in the 30 Days of Python folders is labelled accordingly. 
Feel free to check out the 30 Days of Python tutorials/Courses as they are labelled.
I have tried to name the days and their work appropriately but I might have slipped somewhere.
Thanks to Teclado and Asabeneh for their work.
