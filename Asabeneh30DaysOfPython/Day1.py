#Yesterday I learnt to make this kind of comment.
#This is a single line comment.

"""This helps us write multiline comments
such as this one. Multiline comments
take multiple lines"""

#If a string is more than one sentence, we use triple quotes as well.

#A string is a collection of one or more characters under a SINGLE or DOUBLE quotes

print("My name is Kamikaze.") #My name is Kamikaze is a string.
